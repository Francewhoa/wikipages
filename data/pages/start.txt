===== About OpenNIC =====
OpenNIC (also referred to as the OpenNIC Project) is a user owned and controlled top-level Network Information Center that offers a non-national alternative to traditional Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries such as ICANN.

Use of OpenNIC DNS servers will allow host name resolution in the Legacy U.S. Government DNS, OpenNIC operated namespaces, and those namespaces with which the OpenNIC has peering agreements.

===== This Wiki =====
This wiki is a limited access work area for OpenNIC documentation and other related content. In accordance with OpenNICs philosophy all notes and documents are world-readable. Write access is restricted however to participants relevant for this specific project to provide quality content and have cross-verification by other members.

If you would like to register an account, please follow the sign-up page [[/start?do=register|here]].
===== How you can help =====
The main thing anyone can do to help is to **become a member**. Sign up at http://www.opennicproject.org/members/ and **join our mailing list**! The other great thing you can do to help is to **spread the word**, even if you don't use our TLDs our DNS network is still the quickest around!

**Contributions to the OpenNIC Wiki** are more than welcome. There's lots of stuff to do and missing information needs to be added, articles need to be cleaned and rewritten and other things need to be done. If you're willing to donate some of your free time as contributions to the OpenNIC Wiki, you can do this with just four simple steps:
  - Sign up at http://www.opennicproject.org/members/
  - Log in (with the username and password you chose during sign up) at https://wiki.opennic.org/start?do=login&sectok=
  - Start writing articles or update existing articles. As of this time, there aren't any guidelines in place, so feel free to design the pages in a way you think makes sense.
  - Happy editing and a big thank you from the OpenNIC team!
