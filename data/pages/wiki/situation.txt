====== Current OpenNIC Wiki Situation ======

Or, "What happened to the WikkaWiki?", or "What happened to wiki.opennicproject.org?"... or "Is the wiki down?"

<columns 100% 50% 50%>
===== What We Know =====

  * Due to a yet unknown reason the server on which the WikkaWiki software was hosted has been offline since 2017-04-04.
  * ''2017-04-03T02:26:06Z <Angelica> Shdwdrgn: Thanks, I'll follow the instructions on wiki/API_BindACL'' is the last message from someone who successfully accessed the wiki. 
  * ''2017-04-04T13:39:35Z <Spruce> Is the server hosting the wiki down?'' is the first report of the Wiki being down

<newcolumn>
===== What Is Still Unclear =====

  * What happened to the server?
  * When will it come back online?
  * What's the status of the WikkaWiki database?
  * Will we ever see our again?
  * What will happen to the replacement Wiki in case the WikkaWiki wiki will ever come back online?\\Possibilities for this are:
    * The WikkaWiki instance will be completely replaced by DokuWiki (Requirements to be met are: LDAP authentication)
    * Changes to the wiki pages are backported to the WikkaWiki instance (Requirements to be met are: live mirroring to GitHub and LDAP authentication)
</columns>
For the reasons given, I ([[user:fusl]]) have created a DokuWiki instance with a live mirror to [[https://github.com/OpenNIC/WikiPages|Github / OpenNIC / WikiPages]].
