The link in the box returns your current IP which is then set as the A-record for your *.dyn domain.

So if you run a webserver like Apache on your local machine, the .dyn domain should be served without much fuss.

Update your IP with copy + paste of the API link. This works essentially like a regular dynamic-address DNS-tool.
So save the link as a bookmark for manual surfing - or better - call the URL via **curl** automatically upon address change or using some other automated scheme. 


The A-record returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but it is also used for DNSBLs, storing subnet masks in RFC 1101, etc..

This is an API call available for the  *.dyn  Toplevel-domains such as    http://web.dyn
reload the domain administration page at  http://be.libre   to see the fresh entry. The A-record gets updated upon hitting button "**UPDATE**" .     

"Load this URI to register your IP" - helpful if your address changes after every router reset.
