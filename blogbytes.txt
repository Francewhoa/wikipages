| [[http://gladiator-antivirus.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=57032#entry176945|Gladiator Security Forum]] | 2007-07-05 | I tried with some of those servers from the OpenNIC website and no pages would load at all. |

In fact, to my knowledge, OpenNIC never did the bs "sitefinder" crap OpenDNS does. They also have more DNS servers in more countries. OpenDNS is nothing special. |

Might submit a proposal for a .mono root later and host it. Maybe not Cute thought though. |

Unfortuantely, people are already arguing that the State should bring alternate domain name authorities under regulation, or eliminate them. One justification used for this is that these alternatives may create "collisions" with ICANN, where they create a .com domain-name that collides with ICANN's .com domain-name. |

All you need to do is add one or more of OpenNIC's DNS servers to your operating system's DNS list. Once you have set up your OS to use an OpenNIC nameserver, reaching sites within its namespace is a transparent process. |
