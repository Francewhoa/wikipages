===== About OpenNIC =====
OpenNIC (also referred to as the OpenNIC Project) is a user owned and controlled top-level Network Information Center that offers a non-national alternative to traditional Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries such as ICANN. In case you were looking for them, traditional TLDs are currently served by Network Solutions with policies set by ICANN.

Use of OpenNIC DNS servers will allow host name resolution in the Legacy U.S. Government DNS, OpenNIC operated namespaces, and those namespaces with which the OpenNIC has peering agreements.

===== This Wiki =====
This wiki is a limited access work area for OpenNIC documentation and other related content. In accordance with OpenNICs philosophy all notes and documents are world-readable. Write access is restricted however to participants relevant for this specific project to provide quality content and have cross-verification by other members.

If you would like to register an account, please contact the [[opennic:teams:moderation|moderation team]], [[opennic:teams:administration|administration team]] or [[opennic:teams:core|core team]].
===== How you can help =====
The main thing anyone can do to help is to become a member. Sign up at http://www.opennicproject.org/members/ and join our mailing list! The other great thing you can do to help is to spread the word, even if you don't use our TLDs our DNS network is still the quickest around!

To volunteer assistance with any of these tasks, please enter your name on the relevant project page, then make contact with other team members! These and other 'side projects' are listed at OpenNIC Projects. Once the above tasks are near completion, more will be posted. NB Project areas are currently limited in order to allow timeous forward progress. Should you perchance have ideas for future projects though, please, do get in touch. We are always open to suggestions.

There are plenty of OpenNIC folks available to help with whatever problem you may be having with an OpenNIC server, setup to resolve OpenNIC TLDs, volunteering to set up a Tier 2 server, etc. Please use one of the contact methods listed [[help|here]]
